To build and deploy the team engine, please refer to the
TEAM_Engine_Build_and_Deployment.pdf file under docs/.

It is suggested to setup the users directory so that
the directory is persisted regardless or redeployment
of the engine, thus the usersdir property should be
"${catalina.base}/users" or "${catalina.home}/users".

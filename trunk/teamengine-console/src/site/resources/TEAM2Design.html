    <h1>TEAM Engine Design</h1>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>TEAM Engine is a test script interpreter.It executes tests and test suites written as
      Compliance Test Language (CTL) scripts. There is a core command line version of TEAM Engine,
      as well as a web application for executing test suites from a browser.</p>

    <h2>Technologies</h2>
    <p>TEAM Engine is written using Java (JDK 1.5 or greater).It is tightly coupled to the Saxon
      XSLT engine (version 9). The web version uses Java servlets and JSP. Its authentication code
      depends on Apache Tomcat (version 5 or greater). Some of the web pages use
      javascript/DHTML/AJAX.</p>

    <h2>High Level Design</h2>
    <p>Here is the one paragraph explanation of how TEAM Engine works. When a test suite is
      executed, the source CTL files are converted into XSL files, a separate XSL file for each
      test. TEAM Engine presents the form for the test suite to the user. The values the user enters
      are parameters to the starting test, and they are converted into parameter XML. Then the
      starting test is executed by starting a Saxon transformation using the parameter XML as input
      and the XSL file that was generated for the starting test as the stylesheet. The XSL code
      makes calls to java extension functions. These include a method for calling a subtest, which
      works by performing another Saxon transformation using the XSL that was generated for the
      subtest. The transformations write output to the console and generate log files as they
      progress.</p>

    <h2>TEAM Engine Core</h2>
    <p>The files in the apps/engine directory include the core TEAM Engine files and the lightweight
      command line utility applications. An explanation of the basic processes and concepts involved
      follows:</p>

    <h3>XSL Generation</h3>
    <p>When tests are executed using the Test utility in test mode (the default), the first step is
      to convert the source CTL files into XSL files. This is done using the generateXsl method in
      the Generator class. XSL files are generated for each ctl:test and each ctl:function that
      contains code. Each source file is processed as follows:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Determine the destination directory for the XSL files that will be generated. It will be a
        subdirectory of the working directory. Its name is the full path of the source file, with
        special characters like slashes and backslashes escaped. Create the destination directory if
        it doesn't already exist.</li>

      <li>Compare the date of the source file to the date of "index.xml" in the destination
        directory. If the source file is newer, the XSL files do not need to be regenerated. Skip to
        step 6.</li>

      <li>Validate the source file against the CTL schema. If validation fails print the validation
        errors and go on to the next source file.</li>

      <li>Remove any previously generated files from the destination directory.</li>

      <li>Transform the source file using the generate_xsl.xsl stylesheet. This stylesheet creates
        an XSL file in the destination directory for each ctl:test and each ctl:function that
        contains code. The result document is an index file that contains info on each top-level CTL
        construct (test, function, suite, etc.) in the source file. Save the result document as
        "index .xml" in the destination directory. If the transformation fails, go on to the next
        source file.</li>

      <li>Read the index file into an instance of the Index class. Add each index entry into a
        master instance of the Index class.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>If there were any validation errors or transformation errors this process returns an
      Exception. Otherwise, it returns the master index of top-level CTL constructs as an instance
      of the Index class.</p>

    <h3>Initialize Execution Context</h3>
    <p>After the source files have been generated and indexed, the next step is to initialize an
      execution context. This is done by creating an instance of the Engine class. The Engine class
      is instantiated just once. In the web application, it is initialized on startup and shared
      across all test sessions. The main initialization tasks are:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt>1. Initialize and configure the Saxon processor</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>Multiple transformations take place during execution of a test session, but they all the
          use the same Saxon processor which is initialized and stored in the "processor" member
          variable. The processor is configured to use TEFunctionLibrary, which tells Saxon how to
          bind to the proper code when an XPath expression it is executing calls for a function
          defined by a ctl:function tag.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt>2. Initialize a cache of stylesheets</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>Parsing stylesheets with Saxon can take some time, and the loaded stylesheets can take
          quite a bit of memory. Past versions of TEAM Engine loaded all of the code for all of the
          tests into memory on startup, which caused long initialization times, required lots of
          memory, and did not scale well. Now, TEAM Engine loads a separate stylesheet on demand for
          each ctl:test and ctl:function. Since these stylesheets may be used many times, we
          maintain a cache of the most recently used loaded stylesheets (executables). These are
          stored in the loadedExecutables member variable. When an executable is needed, it may be
          obtained using the loadExecutable method. If necessary, the least recently used
          executable(s) are freed to make room to load a new executable.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt>3. Initialize class loaders</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>In the web application, it is not unusual to have several test suites that depend on
          different versions of the same class or resource. To allow for this, a separate instance
          of TEClassLoader is instantiated for each group of source files.The TEClassLoader will
          first attempt to load resources from its group's resources directory and then fall back to
          the standard TEAM Engine resources if a group-specific resource is not found. The class
          loaders for each group are stored in the "classLoaders" member variable.</p>
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <h3>Execute a Test Suite</h3>
    <p>Once the execution context has been initialized, executing the test suite can begin. To start
      execution, an instance of the TECore class is created and its "execute" method is invoked. If
      the test suite has an associated form, it is displayed. The values the user entered on the
      form are converted to XML in memory. The starting test for the suite is retrieved from the
      master index, and its associated XSL file is loaded as an executable stylesheet. The
      transformation is performed using the XML containing form values as input and the TECore
      object itself as a transformation parameter. The result of the transformation is ignored, but
      output is written to the console and log files are generated as side effects while the
      transformation progresses.</p>

    <p>During the transformation process, Saxon calls callback methods on the TECore object as
      directed by the stylesheet it is executing. The methods that may be called are:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt>
        <code>callTest</code>
      </dt>
      <dd>
        <p>This method executes a test. Parameters are the namespace URI and local name of the test
          to call, an XML representation of the parameters to pass to the test, and a call ID
          string.A &lt;testcall&gt; element is written in the current test's log file. A new
          directory is created in its log directory using the callid parameter as its name. A new
          file named log.xml is created in this directory for the new test. A
          &lt;starttest&gt; element that identifies the test and the values of the
          parameters passed to it is written to the new log file. The test name and assertion are
          also written to the console. The stylesheet associated with the test to be called is
          loaded. It is executed using the XML representation of the parameters as input and the
          TECore object itself as a transformation parameter. When execution is complete, an
          &lt;endtest&gt; element indicating the test results is written to the log file.
          The results are also written to the console. If the result is fail, it causes the active
          test to fail also.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt>
        <code>callFunction</code>
      </dt>
      <dd>
        <p>This method executes a function. Parameters are the namespace URI and local name of the
          test to call, an XML representation of the parameters to pass to the function.</p>
        <p>If the function being called is a CTL function, the stylesheet associated with the
          function is loaded. It is executed using the XML representation of the parameters as input
          and the TECore object itself as a transformation parameter.</p>
        <p>If the function is a Java function, the Java reflection API is used to find the Java
          function with a compatible signature and invoke it.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt>
        <code>fail, warning</code>
      </dt>
      <dd>
        <p>These methods set the test result for the active test (the TECore result member
          variable).</p>
      </dd>
      <dt>
        <code>form</code>
      </dt>
      <dd>
        <p>This method displays a form, waits for user input, and returns the values the user
          entered in the form fields. Parameters are an XHTML representation of the form and a form
          instance ID string.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt>
        <code>form</code>
      </dt>
      <dd>
        <p>This method displays a form, waits for user input, and returns the values the user
          entered in the form fields. Parameters are an XHTML representation of the form and a form
          instance ID string.</p>
        <p>If TEAM Engine was started using the test command line application, this method creates a
          window using the Java Swing toolkit and displays the form XHTML in a JEditorPane control.
          When the user presses the submit button on the form, an XML representation of the form
          fields and their values is returned.</p>

        <p>If TEAM Engine was started as a web application, the form XHTML is saved in the formHtml
          member variable, and the function blocks until values have been returned in the
          formResults member variable. The client (browser) regularly polls the server for status,
          and receives the form XHTML in the formHtml variable when it is available. It displays the
          form. When the user presses the submit button on the form, an XML representation of the
          form fields is set in the formResults variable. This method returns those results.</p>

        <p>A &lt;formresults&gt; element containing the values the user entered is written
          to the log.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt>
        <code>request</code>
      </dt>
      <dd>
        <p>This method submits an HTTP request and returns the results. Parameters are an XML
          representation of the request and a request instance ID string. The request is sent using
          a standard Java URLConnection. The request XML may include a parser instruction, which
          indicates how the response should be parsed into XML. This will refer a parser defined as
          a top-level CTL element (either in the sources loaded or as a built-in parser defined in
          the parsers.ctl resource) and cataloged in the master index. Parsers may be declared as
          initialized or uninitialized. If the parser is not initialized, it refers to a static java
          method to use for extracting XML. The method is invoked, and the parsed XML is returned.
          If the parser is initialized, the method it refers to is not static and its class must be
          instantiated. The member variable parserInstances stores instantiated parser objects. The
          parser object is retrieved from this variable. If it does not already contain an instance
          of the parser, the parser is instantiated and added to the list. Its parsing method is
          invoked, and the parsed XML is returned.</p>
        <p>A &lt;request&gt; element containing the request and the parsed result is written
          to the log.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt>
        <code>message</code>
      </dt>
      <dd>
        <p> This method writes a message to the console. The message is also written to the log in a
          &lt;message&gt; element.</p>
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <h4>Resume Mode</h4>
    <p>If a TEAM Engine test session is interrupted while it is running, execution can be resumed by
      executing the session again in resume mode. Execution proceeds as when starting a new test
      session, except that the behavior of the TECore callback methods callTest, form, and request
      is altered. When mode is resume, the callTest method will first check to see if a log file for
      the subtest to be executed exists and has completed. If so, then it just reads the results
      from the log rather than actually executing the XSL for the subtest. Similarly, the form
      method will use the form results from the log if they exist rather than displaying the form to
      the user again, and the request method will use the response from the log if it exists rather
      than actually submitting the http request again. Execution will proceed very quickly until it
      reaches the end of the log files where the session was first interrupted. Then subtest calls,
      forms, and requests will become active again, and execution will proceed at a normal pace.</p>

    <h4>Retest Mode</h4>
    <p>Specific tests from a previously executed test session may be executed again, perhaps after
      modifying a web service that the test calls. In retest mode, TEAM Engine starts a
      transformation with the executable stylesheet associated with the test to be reexecuted. The
      input XML is a representation of the parameters to pass to the test, read from the log file
      for the previous execution. Retest mode should be used cautiously since the parameters for the
      test are not recalculated. If the parameters to a test were taken from a web service, the
      parent test may need to be reexecuted as well when the web service is modified.</p>


    <h2>TEAM Engine Web</h2>
    <p>The files in the apps/manager directory are installed along with the core TEAM Engine files
      for the web application. An explanation of the basic processes and concepts involved
      follows.</p>

    <dl>
      <dt>Configuration Info</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>Configuration settings are stored in a file called config.xml. It contains settings such
          as the work directory where the generated XSL files are stored, the user's directory where
          user login information and session log files are stored, and information about the
          available test suites. The Config class parses this information and makes it available in
          member functions. Servlets and JSP pages that need this information can instantiate a
          Config class in their init or jspInit method.</p>
      </dd>

      <dt>Authentication</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>Authentication is required before users have access to the test sessions page for
          creating a test session or viewing existing sessions. TEAM Engine uses it own custom
          Tomcat realm, UserFilesRealm. It looks for a directory for the user to be authenticated,
          and reads the password entry from a file called user.xml in that directory, and
          authenticates the user if his password matches. Authentication is for user management
          rather than security. Users that don't have an account can create their own account with
          the registration link. The registration form is processed by RegistrationHandlerServlet,
          which creates the directory for the user and the user.xml file with his password.</p>
      </dd>

      <dt>Test Execution</dt>
      <dd>
        <p>Test execution involves a great deal of cooperation between client (the browser executing
          javascript) and the server. When the user creates a test session, the browser is directed
          to the test.jsp page. When the page is loaded, it starts test execution on the server by
          submitting an AJAX request to the Test servlet with parameter te-operation=Test. When the
          Test servlet receives this request, it starts a new Thread, which creates a TECore object
          and starts the Saxon transformation (as described above in the core execution process).
          The servlet returns some XML that contains the id of the thread it started. The client
          continues by opening a new window to display console output, and by setting up a
          javascript timer to poll the server for status when a short time period has elapsed. When
          the timer expires, it sends a request to the Test servlet with parameter
          te-operation=GetStatus.</p>
      </dd>
    </dl>
    <p>When TEAM Engine is running in web mode, the console output is cached in a variable rather
      than written to standard out. Every time the server receives a request for status, it sends
      the cached console output and clears the cache. It also sends a form flag and an execution
      flag. The client writes the output it received to the console window. The form flag indicates
      whether the server is waiting for form input. If so, the content frame in the browser is
      redirected to the Test servlet with parameter te-operation=GetForm, which displays the form.
      When the user presses submit, it is directed back to the Test servlet with parameter
      te-operation=SubmitForm, which supplies the values the user entered so that test execution can
      resume.</p>

    <p>The client continues to poll the server for status until the execution flag indicates the
      session is complete. Then it loads the results page.</p>

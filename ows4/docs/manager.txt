Installing the TEAM Engine Manager web application.

1) Install JDK 1.5.0 or greater

2) Install Tomcat 5.x or greater

3) Copy the UserFilesRealm.jar file from the setup directory in the teamengine-manager 
binary archive into the Tomcat server/lib directory

4) Copy teamengine.war from the setup directory in the teamengine-manager binary 
archive into the Tomcat webapps directory.  Tomcat should expand the archive and create 
a teamengine directory.

5) Create a directory to store user files.  For example, you might create a directory called 
users in the webapps/teamengine/WEB-INF directory.

6) Update the teamengine context file.  When Tomcat expanded the war file, it should have
created a teamengine.xml context file in the conf/catalina/localhost directory.
Edit this file and change the root attribute on the Realm element to the fully qualified path
name of the directory created in step 5.

7) Create a configuration file called config.xml in the webapps/teamengine/WEB-INF 
/classes/com/occamlab/te/web directory, using config.xml.example as a template.  Set the 
home element to the home URL for the application.  Set the usersdir element to the 
directory you created in step 5.  Create a sources element for each set of source scripts 
you have.  Give it a unique id attribute and enclose source element(s) for each script file 
and/or directory in the collection.

8) Restart Tomcat.  The TEAM Engine Manager web application should now be running 
at http://localhost:8080/teamengine

<h1>TEAM Engine</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
The Test, Evaluation, And Measurement (TEAM) Engine is a test
script interpreter.  It executes test
scripts written in Compliance Test Language (CTL) to verify that an
implementation of a specification complies with the specification.
</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

General installation instructions (for both the console and web interface):

<ol>
  <li> <b>Install JRE 1.5.0</b> -
       You will need a copy of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE),
       version 1.5.0 or greater. If not already installed on your system, 
       download it from <a href="http://java.sun.com">Sun.com</a> 
       and install it.
  </li>
  <li> <b>Install Ant 1.7.0</b> -
       You will need a copy of Ant 1.7.0 to build the source files.  
       If not already on your system, download this from 
       <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Apache.org</a> and install it.
  </li>
  <li> <b>Unpack the TEAM Engine archive</b> -
       Download the latest TEAM binary distribution archive from 
       <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/teamengine/">SourceForge.net</a> 
       and unpack it to the location of your choice.
  </li>
  <li> <b>Set build.properties</b> -
       The TEAM engine requires some local environment variables to be set, such as
       the location of the Java JRE and the location of the servlet container, as
       shown in the build.properties.example file.
  </li>
</ol>

Additional web interface-specific installation steps:<br/>

<ol>
  <li> <b>Install a servlet container (Tomcat 5.5.x)</b> -
       You will need a servlet container to deploy the web component of the 
       engine. The latest production release of Tomcat 5.5 is recommended; 
       download this from <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/">Apache.org</a> 
       and install it.
  </li>
  <li> <b>Add test suites</b> -
       Add any desired test suites to the WEB-INF/scripts/ directory.  Under the 
       root suite directory there should be at least a ctl/ directory to contain 
       the ctl scripts, with optional resources/ (schemas, and other resources to 
       be accessed by the scripts), web/data/ (test data for the scripts), and 
       web/docs/(documentation) directories.
  </li>
  <li> <b>Build the Engine</b> -
       Use the default "build" target in the root build.xml file and copy the content 
       of webapps/ into the Tomcat deployment webapps/ directory.
  </li>
  <li> <b>Copy UserFilesRealm.jar</b> -
       Copy the UserFilesRealm.jar file (located at setup/UserFilesRealm/) into the 
       Tomcat server/lib directory.
  </li>    
  <li> <b>Update the configuration files</b> -
       Ensure that the config.xml file (located in the WEB-INF/classes/ directory)
       correctly refers to the parent directory or main file for each available 
       test suite. Also, the context.xml file (located at teamengine/META-INF/) 
       must identify the appropriate users directory&mdash;the default location 
       is ${catalina.base}/users.
  </li>    
  <li> <b>Start the Tomcat server</b> -
       Start the Tomcat server and access the manager via http://localhost:8080/teamengine (or other
       configured location).
  </li>     
</ol>

<h2>Console Commands</h2>

<h4>Synopsis</h4>

<p>
Execute the commands below by directly calling the Test.java class, or use the Ant function calls in the
build.xml and run-suite.xml files located in the apps/engine/ directory.
</p>

<pre>
Test mode:
  Use to start a test session.

  test [-mode=test] -source={ctlfile|dir} [-source={ctlfile|dir}] ...
    [-suite=[{namespace_uri,|prefix:}]suite_name] [-logdir=dir] [-session=session]

Resume mode:
  Use to resume a test session that was interrupted before completion.

  test -mode=resume -source={ctlfile|dir} [-source={ctlfile|dir}] ...
    -logdir=dir -session=session

Retest mode:
  Use to reexecute individual tests.

  test -mode=retest -source={ctlfile|dir} [-source={ctlfile|dir}] ...
    -logdir=dir test1 [test2] ...

Doc mode:
  Use to generate a list of assertions.

  test -mode=doc -source={ctlfile|dir} [-source={ctlfile|dir}] ...
    [-suite=[{namespace_uri,|prefix:}]suite_name]
</pre>

<p>
In this synopsis, optional items are enclosed in brackets ([]).  Braces ({}) are used to 
indicate options when several values are allowed, and a vertical bar (|) is used to separate 
the options.  Option names and values are case sensitive.
</p>

<h4>Test Mode</h4>

<p>
Use test mode to start a new test session.  You may specify test mode using parameter
-mode=test, or you may omit the -mode parameter since it defaults to test mode.
</p>

<p>
Supply the source CTL file(s) to execute using a -source parameter.  Its value may 
specify a CTL file, or may specify a directory containing multiple CTL files.  If it 
specifies a directory, each file in the directory with a .ctl or a .xml extension is assumed 
to be a CTL file.  Be aware that for each of these files the test tool will create 
intermediate stylesheet files in the source directory with either .txsl (test, resume, and 
retest modes) or .dxsl (doc mode) extensions.
</p>

<p>
You may supply more than one -source parameter.  If there are tests in multiple sources 
with the same qualified name, the tests in the later source location will take precedence.
</p>

<p>
In test mode, execution begins with one of the test suite elements in the source CTL.  If 
there is just one suite in the CTL sources, the test tool will start there, but if there are 
multiple suites, you will need to supply a -suite parameter.  The suite name may be 
specified using the suite elementï¿½s unqualified name, its prefix qualified name, or its 
namespace qualified name.  For the prefix qualified form, use the same namespace prefix 
used in the CTL file, followed by a colon, followed by the base suite name.  For the 
namespace qualified form, use the full namespace URI, followed by a comma, followed 
by the base suite name.
</p>

<p>
It is not necessary to log your test session, but doing so will allow you to use the log 
viewer to see details on any tests that failed, recover if the session is interrupted, or 
reexecute failed tests.  To log the session, supply a -logdir parameter.  Its value should be 
a directory on the local file system.  If the directory does not exist, it is created.
</p>

<p>
Inside the log directory, the system will create a session directory where it will store the 
log files for the new test session.  You may supply a name for this directory using the
-session parameter or the system will create one automatically.  If the session directory 
already exists, its contents will be overridden.
</p>

<h4>Resume Mode</h4>

<p>
Occasionally, a test session may get interrupted.  This could happen if the JVM process 
dies or a test produces a Java exception that halts the test process.  If this happens to a test 
session that is being logged, you can run the test tool again using parameter 
-mode=resume to continue the process where it left off.
</p>

<p>
In resume mode, you must supply the same -source parameter(s) and -logdir parameter 
that were used when the session was started in test mode.  You must also identify the 
session to be resumed with the -session parameter.
</p>

<h4>Retest Mode</h4>

<p>
If for any reason you would like to reexecute any of the tests in a logged test session, run 
the test tool again using parameter -mode=retest.  Supply the same -source parameter(s) 
and -logdir parameter that were used when the session was started in test mode.
</p>

<p>
Following the named parameters, supply a list of the test(s) to be reexecuted.  The tests 
should be identified by their logged test path, which starts with the session identifier.  
This is the value shown in parenthesis following the test name in the test results or test 
summary log.
</p>

<h4>Doc Mode</h4>

<p>
Doc mode does not actually execute any of the CTL code.  It produces a list of the 
assertions in a test suite for documentation purposes.
</p>

<p>
To run the tool in doc mode, specify parameter -mode=doc.  Supply -source 
parameter(s) and, if necessary, a -suite parameter as in test mode.
</p>

<h2>Log Viewer</h2>

<p>
Use the log viewer (viewlog.bat for Windows or viewlog.sh for Unix/Linux) to view test 
results for logged sessions.  Executing the tool with no command-line parameters will 
provide a synopsis as shown below:
</p>

<pre>
To list sessions in a log directory:
  viewlog -logdir=dir

To list tests in a session:
  viewlog -logdir=dir -session=session

To view detailed results for tests:
  viewlog -logdir=dir test1 [test2] ...
</pre>

<p>
The parameters for the log viewer are similar to the parameters for the test tool.  For a list 
the sessions that exist in a log directory, supply the -logdir parameter.  For a hierarchical 
list the tests in a test session and their results, supply both the -logdir parameter and the -
session parameter.  For a detailed result log, including HTTP requests and their results 
and any other logged messages, supply the -logdir parameter and a list of the test(s) to 
view, identified by their test path.
</p>

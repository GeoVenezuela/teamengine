    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <p>
    The Test, Evaluation, And Measurement (TEAM) Engine is a test harness that executes 
    test suites written using the OGC CTL test grammar or the <a href="http://testng.org/" 
    target="_blank">TestNG framework</a>. It is typically used to verify specification 
    compliance and is the official test harness of the <a href="http://cite.opengeospatial.org/" 
    target="_blank">OGC Compliance Testing Program</a> (CITE), where it is used to certify 
    implementations of OGC and ISO geomatics standards.
    </p>
    <p>
    TEAM Engine is a Java application that provides command-line and web interfaces to 
    execute test suites. A REST API is also available to run TestNG-based suites. A Java 
    runtime environment is necessary (JDK 6 or later), and <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/" 
    target="_blank">Apache Tomcat 7</a>  is required to host the web application.
